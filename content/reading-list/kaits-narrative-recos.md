1. [The Game Narrative Toolbox](https://www.routledge.com/The-Game-Narrative-Toolbox/Heussner-Finley-Hepler-Lemay/p/book/9781138787087)

   My go-to. It's an excellent primer and way to lend a common language to practice and process you're probably already doing. Good for AAA, mobile, and indie.

2. [Advanced Game Narrative Toolbox](https://www.routledge.com/The-Advanced-Game-Narrative-Toolbox/Heussner/p/book/9781138499638)

   Follow-up; a bit more focused.

3. [Twisty Little Passages](https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/twisty-little-passages)

   Supposed to be really good for interactive fiction writing.

4. [Procedural Storytelling in Game Design](https://www.routledge.com/Procedural-Storytelling-in-Game-Design-1st-Edition/Short-Adams/p/book/9781138595309)

   Excellent if you're interested in procgen narrative design or writing.

5. [Baldur's Gate II by Matt Bell](https://bossfightbooks.com/products/baldurs-gate-ii-by-matt-bell)

   A really excellent look at how writing practice is applied to a specific game. (My book on Borderlands tried to do this, as well, but I think Matt Bell really succeeded with his).

6. [Character Development and Storytelling for Games](https://www.abebooks.com/9781592003532/Character-Development-Storytelling-Games-Game-1592003532/plp)

   A **tome**, and I've only gotten partway through, but it contextualizes games writing in other media well.
